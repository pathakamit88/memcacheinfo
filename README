This is a django project.

ABOUT:
    This app is used to fetch a single key, all key, flush memcache server and to get server statics.
    This app uses django memcache connection to fetch single value of key and
    flush cache. And for server statics and show all key it uses python
    memcache.py which internally used TCP/IP to connect to memcache server.
    One limitation of this app is memcache should run on same server on which
    project is running. (I am working on this limitation.)

Requirement:
    There is no specific requirement.

Configuration:
    1. Put memcacheinfo is INSTALLED_APPS
    2. put (r'^memcacheinfo/', include('memcacheinfo.urls')), in urls.py

    only user having admin privileges can access memcacheinfo urls otherwise it
    will throw 404 page.
